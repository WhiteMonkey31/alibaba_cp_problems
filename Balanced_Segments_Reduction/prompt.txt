Balanced Segments Reduction

Time limit per test: 2 seconds
Memory limit per test: 256 MB

You are given an array a of n positive integers. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an array b of size n such that:

0 ≤ b[i] ≤ a[i] for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

There exists two cut positions p and q (with 1 ≤ p < q < n) such that:

The sum of the first segment b[1] + ... + b[p]

The sum of the second segment b[p+1] + ... + b[q]

The sum of the last segment b[q+1] + ... + b[n]
are all equal.

Additionally, b[i] must be divisible by i (its 1-based index).

Then, subtract b[i] from a[i] for each i.

Your goal is to reduce all elements of a to 0 in as few operations as possible.

If it is impossible to do so, print -1.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases.
The first line contains t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

For each test case:

The first line contains n (3 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^4) — the length of the array.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^12).

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5·10^4.

Output
For each test case:

If impossible, print -1.

Otherwise:

Print s — the minimum number of operations found.

Then print s lines, each containing the chosen b arrays (space-separated).
