## Approach Overview

This problem requires counting the number of valid arrays that satisfy complex prefix and suffix constraints based on the characters `'A'`, `'B'`, and `'C'` in the input string. Each character dictates specific rules involving counts of distinct integers classified as prime, composite, or neither (specifically the integer 1), and their frequency parity within subarrays.

To solve this, we use **dynamic programming** with multiple states tracking the following parameters:

- The position in the array.
- The count of distinct integers appearing an odd number of times in the prefix.
- The total distinct integers inserted in the prefix.
- The count of distinct prime integers in the prefix.
- The count of distinct composite integers in the prefix.

Similarly, we maintain a suffix DP with analogous states for the suffix part of the array.

## Key Details of the Solution

1. **Prime and Composite Classification**:  
   We classify new integers introduced dynamically into three categories â€” prime, composite, or the special integer 1 (neither). This classification is crucial since the counting constraints depend on how many distinct primes and composites have been introduced.

2. **Prefix and Suffix DP Arrays**:  
   We compute two 5-dimensional DP arrays:
   - `dpPrefix[i][oddCount][D][primeCount][compositeCount]` stores the number of ways to construct the prefix up to position `i` with the specified counts.
   - `dpSuffix[i][evenCount][D][primeCount][compositeCount]` stores the number of ways for the suffix starting at position `i`.

3. **Transition Logic**:  
   For each position `i` and each possible DP state, transitions depend on:
   - The character `s[i]` (`'A'`, `'B'`, or `'C'`).
   - Updating counts of distinct integers appearing odd/even times.
   - Incrementing prime or composite counts if new integers are introduced.
   - Applying the modulo condition for `'C'`.

4. **Combining Prefix and Suffix**:  
   For positions with character `'C'`, the value depends on the sum modulo 3 of distinct primes in prefix and composites in suffix, so we combine prefix and suffix DP states accordingly.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^5)\) per test case due to 5 nested loops in DP states and transitions.
- **Memory Complexity**: \(O(n^5)\) to store the DP arrays.

## Implementation Highlights

- We use modular arithmetic with modulo \(998244353\) to avoid overflow.
- DP initialization sets base cases for empty prefix/suffix.
- The final answer is computed by combining prefix and suffix DP arrays, multiplying ways for each position respecting the character constraints.
- Efficient pruning is done by skipping zero DP states.

## Example Walkthrough

For input:

4
ABCA


- The DP arrays track the possible ways to build arrays consistent with constraints.
- After computing prefix and suffix DP, the final count of valid arrays is output as `24624`.
