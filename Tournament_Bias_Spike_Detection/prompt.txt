Problem Description:
You are given a sequence of N integers. A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of a subsequence that satisfies the following condition:
- No two elements in the subsequence have the same remainder when divided by K.

Input Format:
- The first line contains two integers N and K.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the sequence.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5
- 1 ≤ K ≤ N
- −10^9 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 10^9

Output Format:
- Print a single integer representing the maximum possible sum of a subsequence that satisfies the given condition.

Example:
Input:
5 3
1 7 4 2 5

Output:
14
